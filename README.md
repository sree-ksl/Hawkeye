"Access to communication in the widest sense is access to knowledge, and that is vitally important for us. We do not need pity, nor do we need to be reminded that we are vulnerable. We must be treated as equals, and communication is the way we can bring this about" - Louis Braille, 1841.

Braille is far more than dots on paper! It is not uncommon for someone with a recent vision loss to be unwilling or reluctant to try using braille for reading.Given the high cost of some current braille technology, or the large and cumbersome size of some embossed-paper braille magazines or books, it's not difficult to see why this can often be a challenging.
What's really needed is an affordable, portable device that lures readers into the braille world ... a cool, braille reader that says, "Touch me!" the moment it's picked up!
The project aims to do just that - Create an electronic Braille system that is affordable and can make this technology available to everyone.
